Description:

DS4DS Great Britain energy demand (2009) - Proportions of energy demand projected for future years (for application to table of energy demand data for GB in 2009).
Tables of dimensionless scenario factors for 2000 to 2050 in 5-year steps for domestic and non-domestic heat and non-heating electricity demand for two scenarios: UKERC scenarios ADD and LC
Please acknowledge the School of Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University when making any use of this data. Two csv files, one for each scenario.
Methods and results were reported in Taylor S, Firth S, Wang C, Allinson D, Quddus M, Smith P (2014) Spatial mapping of building energy demand in Great Britain. Global Change Biology Bioenergy, 123-135.
